# Replace `chsh` with a fail-safe profile/exec dance:
# When /bin/sh -> /bin/bash or /bin/zsh are the default shells on the system,
# starting a login shell with source ~/.bash_profile or ~/.zprofile respectively.
# In those places dry-run the nix-managed zsh to ensure it works. If so, exec it.
# In case it fails, we fall back to the login shell.
# This will not affect the hot path (tmux creating a new pane) as the default shell
# for tmux is determined from the SHELL variable when the server is first started.
# The server is started AFTER the initial profile dance concluded.
#
# HOW TO TEST
# - Check that /bin/bash, /bin/sh, and /bin/zsh as login shells start up right:
# `env -u SHELL /bin/bash -il`
# - All these invocations should result in a ZSH shell running.
# Check with
# `ps -p $$ -o 'comm='`
# - There should be no infitite recursions.
# - when exiting the login shell, it should exit cleanly.
#   - There should be no need to doubly exit the shell.
